Description: The modeling and prediction of graph-associated time series(GATS) based on continuous time quantum walk. This software is mainly used for feature extraction, modeling, prediction and result evaluation of GATS, including continuous time quantum walk simulation, feature selection, regression analysis, time series prediction, and series fit calculation. A paper is attached to the package for reference.
