Description: Modeling and predicting time series based on continuous time quantum.This package can be divided into three parts: Basis Generation, Data Modeling and Prediction, and Model Evaluation according to the analysis process of time series. 'Basis Generation' has realized the continuous time quantum walk simulation for generating modes as the basis. Some regression methods are used to model the observed time series and predict in 'Data Modeling and Prediction', and 'Model Evaluation' can be used to evaluate the data correspondence between two series.
